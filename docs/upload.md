## Use 

#### Main

```markup
upload.js
upload.css
```

#### Dependencies

```markup
jQuery
core.js
```

### Basic

Upload will create a simple 'drop zone' for file uploads:

```javascript
$(".target").upload({
	action: "upload.php"
});
```

```markup
<div class="target"></div>
```

### Uploads

Upload does not store or manipulate uploaded files on the server, it simply facilitates the asynchronous upload process from the front end.

## Options

Set instance options by passing a valid object at initialization, or to the public `defaults` method. Custom options for a specific instance can also be set by attaching a `data-upload-options` attribute to the target elment. This attribute should contain the properly formatted JSON object representing the custom options.
