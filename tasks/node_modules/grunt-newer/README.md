# grunt-newer

Configure [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) tasks to run with newer files only.

**Synopsis:**  The [`newer`](#newer) task will configure another task to run with `src` files that are *a)* newer than the `dest` files or *b)* newer than the last successful run (if there are no `dest` files).  See below for examples and more detail.

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.1`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [`gruntfile.js`](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-newer --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your `gruntfile.js` with this line:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-newer');
```

<a name="newer"></a>
## The `newer` task

The `newer` task doesn't require any special configuration.  To use it, just add `newer` as the first argument when running other tasks.

For example, if you want to use [Uglify](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-contrib-uglify) to minify your source files only when one or more of them is newer than the previously minified destination file, configure the `uglify` task as you would otherwise, and then register a task with `newer` at the front.

```js
  grunt.initConfig({
    uglify: {
      all: {
        files: {
          'dest/app.min.js': ['src/**/*.js']
        }
      }
    }
  });

  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-uglify');
  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-newer');

  grunt.registerTask('minify', ['newer:uglify:all']);
```

With the above configuration the `minify` task will only run `uglify` if one or more of the `src/**/*.js` files is newer than the `dest/app.min.js` file.

The above example shows how the `newer` task works with other tasks that specify both `src` and `dest` files.  In this case, the modification time of `src` files are compared to modification times of corresponding `dest` files to determine which `src` files to include.

The `newer` task can also be used with tasks that don't generate any `dest` files.  In this case, `newer` will only use files that are newer than the last successful run of the same task.

For example, if you want to run [JSHint](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-contrib-jshint) on only those files that have been modified since the last successful run, configure the `jshint` task as you would otherwise, and then register a task with `newer` at the front.

```js
  grunt.initConfig({
    jshint: {
      all: {
        src: 'src/**/*.js'
      }
    }
  });

  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-jshint');
  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-newer');

  grunt.registerTask('lint', ['newer:jshint:all']);
```

With the above configuration, running `grunt lint` will configure your `jshint:all` task to use only files in the `jshint.all.src` config that have been modified since the last successful run of the same task.  The first time the `jshint:newer:all` task runs, all source files will be used.  After that, only the files you modify will be run through the linter.

Another example is to use the `newer` task in conjunction with `watch`.  For example, you might want to set up a watch to run a linter on all your `.js` files whenever one changes.  With the `newer` task, instead of re-running the linter on all files, you only need to run it on the files that changed.

```js
  var srcFiles = 'src/**/*.js';

  grunt.initConfig({
    jshint: {
      all: {
        src: srcFiles
      }
    },
    watch: {
      all: {
        files: srcFiles,
        tasks: ['newer:jshint:all']
      }
    }
  });

  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-jshint');
  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-watch');
  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-newer');

```

With the above configuration, running `grunt jshint watch` will first lint all your files with `jshint` and then set up a watch.  Whenever one of your source files changes, the `jshint` task will be run on just the modified file.

*Note:* If your task is configured with `dest` files, `newer` will run your task with only those files that are newer than the corresponding `dest` files.

## Options for the `newer` task

In most cases, you shouldn't need to add any special configuration for the `newer` task.  Just `grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-newer')` and you can use `newer` as a prefix to your other tasks.  The options below are available for advanced usage.

#### <a id="optionscache">options.cache</a>
 * type: `string`
 * default: `node_modules/grunt-newer/.cache`

To keep track of timestamps for successful runs, the `newer` task writes to a cache directory.  The default is to use a `.cache` directory within the `grunt-newer` installation directory.  If you need timestamp info to be written to a different location, configure the task with a `cache` option.

Example use of the `cache` option:

```js
  grunt.initConfig({
    newer: {
      options: {
        cache: 'path/to/custom/cache/directory'
      }
    }
  });
```

#### <a id="optionsoverride">options.override</a>
 * type: `function(Object, function(boolean))`
 * default: `null`

The `newer` task determines which files to include for a specific task based on file modification time.  There are occassions where you may want to include a file even if it has not been modified.  For example, if a LESS file imports some other files, you will want to include it if any of the imports have been modified.  To support this, you can provide an `override` function that takes two arguments:

 * **details** - `Object`
   * **task** - `string` The currently running task name.
   * **target** - `string` The currently running target name.
   * **path** - `string` The path to a `src` file that appears to be "older" (not modified since the time below).
   * **time** - `Date` The comparison time.  For tasks with `dest` files, this is the modification time of the `dest` file.  For tasks without `dest` files, this is the last successful run time of the same task.
 * **include** - `function(boolean)` A callback that determines whether this `src` file should be included.  Call with `true` to include or `false` to exclude the file.

Example use of the `override` option:

```js
  grunt.initConfig({
    newer: {
      options: {
        override: function(detail, include) {
          if (detail.task === 'less') {
            checkForModifiedImports(detail.path, detail.time, include);
          } else {
            include(false);
          }
        }
      }
    }
  });
```

#### <a id="optionstolerance">options.tolerance</a>
 * type: `number` (milliseconds)
 * default: `0`

The `newer` tasks compares the file modification times of the source and destination files with millisecond precision.
On some file systems this causes destination files to always be considered older because of imprecision in the registration of modification times.

If your tasks are always run even though the source files are not modified use the `tolerance` option to compensate for this imprecision.

In most cases setting the option to `1000` milliseconds should be enough. If the file system is very imprecise use a higher value.

Example use of the `tolerance` option:

```js
  grunt.initConfig({
    newer: {
      options: {
        tolerance: 1000
      }
    }
  });
```

## Known limitations

The `newer` task relies on Grunt's convention for specifying [`src`/`dest` mappings](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks#files).  So it should be expected to work with two types of tasks:

1) Tasks that specify both `src` and `dest` files.  In this case, the task prefixed by `newer` will be configured to run with `src` files that are newer than the corresponding `dest` file (based on the `mtime` of files).

2) Tasks that specify only `src` files.  In this case, the task prefixed by `newer` will be configured to run with `src` files that are newer than the previous successful run of the same task.

The `newer` task will *not* work as a prefix for the following tasks:

 * [`grunt-rsync`](http://npmjs.org/package/grunt-rsync) - Though this task specifies `src` and `dest` files, the `dest` file is not generated based on `src` files (instead it is a directory).
